# noise-reduction-butterworth
Designing a butterworth filter to supress noise from an audio file in MATLAB with a maximally flat response in the passband or stopband.

#Problem:
Improving the quality of human speech by removing unwanted noise is a complex engineering challenge. Environmental noise and poor recording quality can degrade the effectiveness of speech as a means of communication. In order to address this issue, noise reduction techniques must be employed to enhance the clarity of speech signals. However, it is crucial to design filters with great care to achieve effective noise reduction while avoiding any undesired distortions or artifacts that could compromise the quality of the speech signal.
